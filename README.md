## Installation

Nothing To Install Here :

```
Scripts are seperated based on their use & are organised ino folders
linux & windows scripts of common purpose are seperated in compaible formats
```

## Usage example

You can start a project and have the interface linked to one of my already existing interface/utility program from this repository. The goal here is simple, that is to re-use code and programs with ease.  

## Development setup

Again nothin to install, just pick your script, mode it, test, kang it & you are ready to go !
